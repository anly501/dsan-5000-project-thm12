# Introduction
## Vertical Jump in Basketball

The sport of basketball, often synonymous with the towering presence of its players, is hailed as a sport favoring those with an imposing height. Anyone with an above-average height as a child or even an adult has likely been asked if they play basketball. But for those who aren’t naturally gifted with height, the great equalizer is their jumping ability, specifically, vertical jump, the height a person can jump vertically. It allows shorter players to even the playing field and even soar to greater heights than those naturally taller. The act of jumping in basketball has always captivated the masses. High-flying dunks are constantly going viral on social media, and some of the most iconic photos and moments in the sport involve jumping, such as the iconic Air Jordan “Jumpman” logo, which pictures Michael Jordan soaring through the air for a dunk. Vertical jump has become an act that is integral to the sport of basketball and athletic performance.

This relationship is one that is seen not just in observation but in research as well. One publication titled, <u>Vertical Jump in female and male basketball players—A review of observational and Experimental Studies</u>, reviewed 26 studies on vertical jump performances in elite basketball players, revealing significant variations attributed to diverse testing protocols and player skill levels. In this, two studies were cited that looked at the involvement of vertical jump in the game of basketball. McInnes et al. discovered that, typically, a basketball player engages in 1050 ± 51 movements throughout the game, including activities like standing, running, walking, and jumping, with approximately 46 ± 12 of these actions being vertical jumps. In a similar context, Ben Abdelkrim, El Fazaa, and El Ati reported figures of 997 ± 183 and 44 ± 7, respectively. The publication also stated what can be commonly observed, which is that many maneuvers in basketball involve jumping, such as rebounding, dunking, contesting a shot, and shooting both a jump shot or a layup.

Besides its direct involvement in the game of basketball, the vertical jump is also recognized and measured across a variety of sports due to its implications on a person’s overall athleticism. A player in any given sport that is able to jump high is also expected to be generally strong and coordinated, as it takes both attributes to be able to jump high. Another study titled, <u>Are vertical jump height and power output correlated to physical performance in different sports? An allometric approach</u>, aimed to explore the relationship between various vertical jump parameters and specific physical performance across different sports, employing an allometric approach to adjust power output for body mass. The results revealed moderate to very substantial correlations between physical performance and jump height, peak power output, and mean power output. Notably, when power output was adjusted for body mass, the correlation with physical performance tended to be stronger. The study also underscored the similarity in the correlation magnitudes of jump height and power output with physical performance tests across different sports.

With all that being said about the relevance of vertical jump to both basketball and general athleticism, this project will look at just how important it actually is. Specifically in terms of in-game basketball performance and athletic performance. It will look at both vertical jump and its relation to basketball performance from a data science perspective. Some of the specific questions it looks to address are:

- What other athletic abilities are correlated to jumping higher in basketball?
- Does speed affect vertical jump (i.e., sprint speed)?
- Do certain positions jump higher?
- Does jumping higher translate to improved on-court performance at the NBA level?
- Does height affect jumping ability?
- Does weight affect jumping ability?
- Are players jumping higher as time goes on and training methods improve?
- Do players from certain nationalities jump higher?
- How does the jumping ability of NBA players compare to players of other sports like Football and the NFL?
- Can other factors like warming up and stretching affect jumping ability?

I hope looking at these questions through a data science lens will shed light on vertical jump and its relationship to basketball in terms of on-court success. Because of data availability, I will specifically be looking at the NBA (National Basketball Association) for basketball, as it is considered the best basketball league in the world with the best players in the world and is well-tracked in terms of statistics on players and games.  

This project will go through steps of the data-science life-cycle in order to provide insights on the questions and general topic. These steps include Data Gathering, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Naive Bayes, Clustering, Dimensionality reduction, Decision Trees, and Final Conclusions.


Before jumping in, I have some initial hypotheses for some of the questions posed based on personal experience and intuition. I hypothesize smaller and lighter players will tend to jump higher. I think jumping higher will slightly correlate to better on-court performance for NBA players. I believe agility and speed will have a positive correlation to vertical jump. I do not think nationality will not play a major role in vertical jump. I think players are jumping higher over time due to advancements in technology and training methods. I also think players from other sports will have a similar vertical jump ability depending on the athleticism required in the sport. And lastly, I believe warming up and stretching moderately improves vertical jump. Hopefully, the data-science life-cycle will be able to provide further insights on these questions that are rooted in data and data analysis.
