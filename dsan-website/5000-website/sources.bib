	abstract = {The main purpose of this article was to review a series of studies (n=26; 15 observational and 11 experimental) examining vertical jump (VJ) performances in female and male basketball players. Information on the tests used in these studies and their specific protocols, and the training programs conducted to improve VJ ability in elite basketball players, was assessed. It was found that vertical jump values varied greatly, from 22 to 48cm in female players and from 40 to 75cm in male players. These large variations can be explained mostly by the differences in testing protocols (each VJ protocol examined different physiological pathways) and skill level of players. The variations in VJ values among studies were greatly reduced when they used the same protocol. In addition, short plyometric training sessions as part of the strength and conditioning program were found to enhance VJ performances in basketball players. Based on the reviewed studies, five limitations associated with the testing protocols and the strength and conditioning programs used in the studies were outlined, among them the use of multiple testing protocols and lack of experimental studies. Three recommendations for basketball and strength and conditioning coaches were suggested, for one of which was including plyometric training in the annual training program.},
