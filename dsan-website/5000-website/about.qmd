He is positioning himself on the cutting edge of how data, particularly AI, will change the future. 

Tyler is also a Commission Member and Ambassador for the World Dunk Association, striving to create a more fair and objective scoring system for dunk contests with a mission to legitimize dunking as its own sport through organized competitions and to promote further education about the sport with the ultimate goal of making it an official Olympic sport. He is an avid dunker, enjoys weightlifting, and is a certified Community Emergency Response Team member and Ski Patrol. 

Tyler is a graduate of Tahoe Expedition Academy, a new model of education in the mountains of Northern California that deploys expedition learning on real-world problem-solving. Students spend more than 30 days in the field each academic year to learn about issues such as climate change, systemic poverty, social justice, and immigration. The school is pioneering “constructive adversity” that involves pushing young people out of their comfort zones so they can learn and grow. Tyler has led and participated in field studies on US recidivism, climate change in the Olympia Valley, disaster relief from Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Haitian migration in the Dominican Republic.
