        "This data was gathered from Kaggle and represents the NBA draft combine testing results from the year 2000 to 2022. The NBA combine is an event in which NBA draft prospects are tested and measured on a number of physical and athletic attributes, including their standing vertical jump and their running vertical jump (max vertical jump). It is one of the few events in sports in which players' physical attributes and athletic abilities are measured in an official and objective manner. I selected this dataset as it will be useful to measure whether there are other physical predictors for vertical jump, as well as for merging with season and game data to see whether vertical jump has an affect on in game performance.\n",

It includes averages and totals from stats like points, rebounds, assists, and other game stats. I included this dataset as I plan to merge it with the previous NBA combine data to see if vertical jump has any relation to in game success for certain stats. I obtained a dataset with every players stats from each season by looping through years and querying the data from each season and then adding it to a single dataset. \n",

I selected this dataset to compare the numbers to the NBA combine and compare how vertical jump for basketball players compares to other athletes, and the NFL is the only other league with a widely covered combine.\n",
