    "text": "About Tyler McCormick\n\nBio\nTyler McCormick is a senior at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business pursuing a fifth-year Master’s in Data Science and Analytics. His work experience includes two early-stage startups, Nodar and Margot’s Morsels, supporting financial analysis and marketing and helping a large $2 billion consumer product and service company, Leaf Home, understand opportunities to significantly improve their gross margins. Majoring in operations and analytics, Tyler is building foundational business skills and expertise in helping businesses use data-driven decisions as a competitive advantage by leveraging data for real-time decision-making and long-term strategy. He is positioning himself on the cutting edge of how data, particularly AI, will change the future.\nTyler is also a Commission Member and Ambassador for the World Dunk Association, striving to create a more fair and objective scoring system for dunk contests with a mission to legitimize dunking as its own sport through organized competitions and to promote further education about the sport with the ultimate goal of making it an official Olympic sport. He is an avid dunker, enjoys weightlifting, and is a certified Community Emergency Response Team member and Ski Patrol.\nTyler is a graduate of Tahoe Expedition Academy, a new model of education in the mountains of Northern California that deploys expedition learning on real-world problem-solving. Students spend more than 30 days in the field each academic year to learn about issues such as climate change, systemic poverty, social justice, and immigration. The school is pioneering “constructive adversity” that involves pushing young people out of their comfort zones so they can learn and grow. Tyler has led and participated in field studies on US recidivism, climate change in the Olympia Valley, disaster relief from Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Haitian migration in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\nEducation\n\nGerogetown University\n\nMaster of Science in Data Science and Analytics\n\n\n\nGeorgetown University, McDonough School of Business\n\nBS, Major: Operations and Analytics, Minor: Entrepreneurship\n\n\n\nTahoe Expedition Academy"

    "text": "It does not take much evidence to show that sports and the sports industry have a massive influence both within the United States and throughout the world. The sports industry had a global revenue of 487 billion USD in 2022, according to statista.com. Strength is pivotal in athletic performance, serving as a fundamental component across various sports. While the degree of importance attributed to strength may vary from one sport to another, it remains a crucial factor in nearly every athletic endeavor. While skill and technique undeniably contribute to success, the prevailing belief is that stronger athletes often hold a significant competitive advantage and are typically considered better overall athletes. This perspective is reinforced by the stringent measures taken by many sports leagues, which ban and rigorously test for the use of performance-enhancing substances such as anabolic steroids. These regulations underscore the acknowledgment within the sports community that strength is a vital determinant of an athlete’s prowess.\nScientific studies further prove this point. A review article by Timothy J. Suchomel, Sophia Nimphius & Michael H. Stone titled, The Importance of Muscular Strength in Athletic Performance looks at previous literature that examines strength’s role in sports. The authors concluded that studies showed muscular strength highly correlated to better sprinting, jumping, changing direction, and sports performance. Not only this, but stronger individuals face a lower risk of injury. Evidence strongly suggests that improving muscular strength has no substitute for enhancing various attributes associated with athletic performance while reducing the risk of injury during these activities. For these reasons, athletes should aim to become as strong as possible within their sport’s context, as strength serves as a foundation for attributes that help improve athletic performance and reduce injury. (Suchomel, Nimphius, and Stone 2016)\nWith the established importance of strength, specifically in the context of sports, athletes are constantly looking for ways to improve their strength. This project will look at the factors that affect strength in athletes from a data science perspective. It will look at specific categories of factors such as training, nutrition, and recovery and what category of factors appear to have the greatest impact. The specific questions that will be addressed are:\n\nWhat is the most important factor that contributes to strength in athletes?\nHow does resistance training impact strength gains?\nWhat is the significance of periodization in designing strength and training programs?\nHow do different training modalities (e.g., weightlifting, powerlifting, Olympic lifting) affect specific aspects of strength?\nHow does nutrition, including macronutrient intake and timing of meals, influence an athlete’s strength?\nWhat role do supplements like creatine and caffeine play in enhancing strength performance?\nHow does hydration status affect an athlete’s ability to generate force?\nHow does adequate rest and sleep impact an athlete’s strength outputs?\nWhat recovery strategies, such as foam rolling and massage, contribute to maintaining optimal performance?\nHow can overtraining and fatigue negatively affect strength gains?\nWhat psychological techniques can enhance an athlete’s performance in maximal efforts?\nTo what extent do an athlete’s genetics influence their potential for developing strength?\nHow do age, gender, and body composition affect an individual’s strength capabilities?\n\nThere are a number of existing studies and literature that look at specific aspects of these questions. For example, another article by Timothy J. Suchomel, Sophia Nimphius, Christopher R. Bellon, & Michael H. Stone titled, The Importance of Muscular Strength: Training Considerations, looks at how different types of training affect strength. This article underscored that the development of muscular strength involves a multifaceted interplay of factors, including muscle hypertrophy, neuromuscular adaptations, and coordination. Diverse training modalities, such as resistance training or bodyweight exercises, influence these elements to facilitate strength gains. Moreover, strategic programming considerations, including factors like set volume and inter-set rest intervals, finely modulate the adaptive response. For individuals with a limited baseline strength, prioritizing hypertrophy and neuromuscular adaptation is prudent before emphasizing speed-related attributes. Conversely, those with substantial strength can enhance their performance by concentrating on speed-oriented training. (Suchomel et al. 2018)\nAnother review article and study by Olivier Dupuy, Wafa Douzi, Dimitri Theurot, Laurent Bosquet, and Benoit Dugué titled, An Evidence-Based Approach for Choosing Post-exercise Recovery Techniques to Reduce Markers of Muscle Damage, Soreness, Fatigue, and Inflammation: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis, identified various recovery techniques that can alleviate delayed onset muscle soreness and perceived fatigue after a single exercise session. This relates to strength, as recovery can affect strength gains and the ability for athletes to continue to train for strength. The article concludes that massage appears to be the most effective, followed by water immersion and compression garments. For managing perceived fatigue, compression techniques work well. Massage and cold exposure, like water immersion and cryotherapy, are effective to combat inflammation. However, the study ultimately concludes that more research is needed to assess these techniques with regular use and explore potential synergies between them for improved athlete performance. (Dupuy et al. 2018)\nBased on existing literature and personal experience, I would hypothesize that genetics, training, and nutrition contribute the most to strength in athletes. Specifically, weight training, proper protein, and micronutrient intake are the controllable factors that contribute to strength in athletes the most. However, I hope to have a more refined and evidence-based answer through data analysis in this study."
