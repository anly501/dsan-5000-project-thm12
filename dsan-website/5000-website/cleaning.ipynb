        "I cleaned this data with the intent to merge it with NBA player season data. The first thing I had to do with the NBA combine data was adjust the format of the player name column. I changed the format from (Last, First) to (First Last) using strsplit and sapply in R. I also changed the name of the column from \"PLAYER\" to \"Name\" so that can merge the dataset by \"Name\". I then renamed some other columns to be more clear, and dropped those that were not needed. I also made some another version where I got rid of NA values in order to use the dataset for Naive Bayes and other ML models later. One of the combine drills was implemented in 2009, so I removed all values prior to that year. I also added a binary feature that represents if the players maximum vertical is above the mean of the dataset.\n",

I subsetted the data to only keep one value for each player in order to merge with the NBA combine dataset. I wanted to keep the version of each player in which they had their best season. I did this by keeping the version of each player that had the the most points for the season. Points are generally the most important stat in basketball, and while assists and rebounds are important, total points should be a good indicator of a season in which a player had one of their best years and remained healthy enough to play most of the season. I then deleted a pleathura of columns that would not be useful in indicating in game performance.

The extract_content function was then created to extract the 'content' from the input data and store it in a new list. After that, I used the join_lists function to concatenate the cleaned content strings. I applied the list_string_cleaner function to the \"cleaned_news_text\" column of the DataFrame, ensuring that each string in the column underwent the specified cleaning processes. Next, I utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for lemmatization and defined custom stopwords and stoplemmas. The remove_special_chars and remove_digits functions were introduced to handle punctuation and digits, respectively. The clean function was designed to lowercase the text, tokenize sentences and words, remove stopwords, digits, special characters, and lemmatize words. Finally, I performed vectorization using Count Vectorizer, specifying parameters for maximum document frequency and minimum document count, and saved the resulting feature names and matrix using joblib."
